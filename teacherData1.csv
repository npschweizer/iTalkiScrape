For the last few years, I have been helping people like you become more confident speakers, regardless of the language they are learning - this, through one-on-one teaching and conversation practice here on italki.
I have been tutoring foreign languages part time since 1998. In 2016, I got involved full time, started teaching ESL locally, and mentored under the best teachers I could find. Learning and teaching Esperanto has broadened my knowledge of my own native English, and helped me learn how to explain things in a clear and understandable way.","Teaching (and language learning) is who I am. In university, many of my friends were international students. I took pride in my ability to adapt my English to the appropriate level as they progressed. I was learning German, and this really helped me see things from their perspective. Now I am well-known in the Esperanto community - a regular teacher-in-residence at NASK and other events. In 1988 I became a tutor in a Free Esperanto Course (which I now administer), and when I left my IT career in 2016, I started teaching once a week at the local ESOL Association, as well as tutoring on line and in person. Teaching different languages in these situations has given me a unique perspective.","The main thing is that I want my students to speak. The first step is to feel comfortable.

"Writing a short story. Reading a fantasy novel. Socializing with friends, and enjoying a warm cup of coffee—these are just a few things that bring me satisfaction! In addition to that, I am currently studying Elementary Education, Language Arts, and Mandarin Chinese at an accredited university.","I know what it is like to learn a new language. I strongly believe that language learning should be engaging for the learner. I desire to facilitate interesting conversations and lead my students as they navigate pronunciation, reading, listening, and writing English. Moreover, I hope to create a comfortable space where I am trusted by my students. Always having had the desire to teach, I want to assist my students, challenge them, and urge them that they are fully capable of becoming an improved English speaker.","My teaching style consists of engaging the learner in various ways. To illustrate, I will first find out what the learner needs so that I might be able to teach the material in the framework of those needs. In addition to personalized learning, I will integrate direct instruction in which I teach grammar rules, pronunciation, vocabulary, etc. However, in order to attract the student, I plan on facilitating discussions that are of interest to the student.",https://www.italki.com/teacher/3747225/english,5,152 LESSONS,81 STUDENTS,152,0,0,19,"[157, 168, 168, 75]","[11, 20, 20, 0]","[28, 8, 8, 2]"
"Hello everyone, my name is Dewey Tran and I teach English and Vietnamese on Italki. I was originally born and raised in Saigon, Vietnam, and migrated to Pennsylvania, United States when I was little. Where I live is roughly an hour and a half of drive time to Philadelphia or New York City. I go to those cities often so if you have plans to visit, I can give you some pointers. During my time living here in the US, I've acquired English as my primary language but I still use Vietnamese every day to talk to my parents.","I think that my interest has always been to understand people better; and more than that, to help people understand each other better. This is exactly why I pursuit teaching a language online. That said, I cannot wait to meet every single one of you!","My specialization is to help you acquire fluency in a language via comprehensible input. Comprehensible input is just a fancy term for understanding the messages that you receive. Since I only like to teach using only the target language, I always want to make sure we understand each other and improve our language accuracy. We can achieve this goal together in many ways during our lessons, such as talking to each other, reading to each other, telling a story to each other, and creating a story together.
I can also help you prepare for any language proficiency tests, or just casually having a conversation with you to go over any question you may have.",https://www.italki.com/teacher/2966241/english,5,102 LESSONS,34 STUDENTS,102,0,0,49,"[164, 142, 142, 142]","[1, 5, 20, 20]","[31, 21, 6, 6]"
"Je m'appelle Marie, et je travaille comme consultante dans l’industrie informatique. À université, je me suis spécialisée en les communications, et le français.

Pour cette raison, J’ai hâte de vous apprendre ma langue maternelle! 

My name is Marie, and I am a consultant working in the health/information technology industry. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Communications from the University of Kansas, and I have formally studied French for 8 years, and Hindi for 3 years. Languages are my passion and I love the thrill of learning new things!","I believe it is important for the teacher to facilitate learning through conversation in the target language. While I like to focus on speaking practice with my students, grammar concepts and vocab can be included in the lessons. 
I try to pose new questions and real-life situations that the student may encounter in an English-speaking country. I’m also a fan of helping the student be able to formulate their own thoughts and ideas in the language. I am here as a guide on your language journey!
*Please note that I am NOT a professional! I CANNOT provide IELTS or formal test preparation.
*Please note that I DO NOT teach kids.
*Please take a trial lesson with me BEFORE you book a package!","My main courses are conversation practice lessons. I will prepare general questions and conversations upon our first lesson together. If you would like to practice something very specific, please let me know in ADVANCE. 

Some topics I teach in conversation are:

Travel/Tourist Phrases
Household 
Family/Friends
Study Abroad, etc.

I like to use quizlet for vocab, and youtube videos for listening practice that the student can watch before class. I also like to be expressive and use facial expressions and hand gestures to convey meaning (especially for beginners!) For more advanced students, we will try to cover relevant news topics and faster conversation.

"Hi, my name is Corey. I'm an American living in New York City. I love my city and all that it has to offer. It's a huge melting pot of people and opportunity and I want to be able to share a bit of that with the world. I am also a language student so I fully understand how hard learning a language can be.

I've lived and travelled most of the United States but I'm also a huge international traveler as well. I love getting to learn about different parts of the world and their customs. I have a lot of hobbies aside from traveling, but the most important to me are; food, coffee, hiking, skiing, books, and theatre. 

Hope to be chatting with you soon!","As a teacher I want to make conversation key, as well as show my students examples of real everyday spoken English. Listening to as much of a foreign language as possible helps to train the ear to hear the subtle differences, as well as trains us to make small corrections to errors we make ourselves. Through conversation I also want to provide corrections so that the student can begin to identify areas of weakness and repeated mistakes, to be able to change those structural issues. 

I want to make it relaxed and comfortable. Learning a language is hard, so we shouldn't pressure ourselves to be prefect.","Having learned a foreign language through immersive/conversational practice I generally encourage having about half of my lessons be conversational. I also want to be able to provide; movies, music, written materials and homework assignments to be able to keep the environment varied, as well as fun.

Homework is totally up to the schedule of the student. I think homework is helpful, mostly as a way to keep students partially in a mode of learning. The more integrated a language is into our everyday, the easier and faster the learning process is. It's okay if, however, a students schedule doesn't allow it. It's your lessons, so I want to make them as accessible to your life as possible.",https://www.italki.com/teacher/6600929/english,5,149 LESSONS,78 STUDENTS,149,19,40,33,"[74, 74, 74, 74]","[6, 6, 6, 6]","[4, 4, 4, 4]"

"I’m an American professional TEFL teacher, currently living in Shanghai, China with my wife and son. I compose and perform music in my spare time.

Free online 1-to-1 video communication is the ideal environment for working with a language tutor – an ‘academically intimate’ atmosphere. I bring to each private class years of experience with helping students get the best results from this ideal learning environment.
