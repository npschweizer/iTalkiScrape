Context-based learning (CBL)- Using pictures and real or fictitious scenarios to understand how language is used in a real-world setting.
Content and language integrated learning (CLIL)- Exploring different subject material while learning language.

Besides language learning, I enjoy traveling and trying new things, which supports my work as an artist.  I am a commercial and editorial photographer.

Language learning should be enjoyable, not a burden.  People should focus on establishing connections with various cultures.  At that point, language becomes more than just words and rules.  It becomes a true form of expression.

As a teacher, I like to help my students appreciate language for the art that it is.  We don't just spend time memorizing rules.  We learn why these rules exist, where they come from, and how they affect more things than we realize.  I'm a fun teacher, yet organized.  I'm flexible and always willing to help you!","Personally, I have found that the most teachable thing about a language is grammar.  However, I also specialize in teaching English pronunciation and conversation skills.

Vocabulary is usually something that someone can and does learn on their own, though we will spend time learning the essential, advanced, and colloquial language.  Grammar, on the other hand, typically requires someone who can walk us through how and when to use each concept (like whether you should use the simple past or the present perfect).

I remained there until returning home from Thailand in February of 2009.

To do this we will first assess the four language skills: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. During this phase there will be fewer mistakes corrected, however, necessary corrections will be made to avoid the development of bad habits. As the student progresses, we can move on to improve ""micro-skills"" such as grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and spelling.

When studying with me, you will have great conversations, learn and practice grammatical concepts, and improve your reading and pronunciation.
