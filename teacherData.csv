Don't worries if you are just an absolute beginner, since I can teach in various languages that I'm using fluently, English, Chinese Mandarin and Japanese! You can also book the lesson to practice your English, Chinese Mandarin and Japanese in Vietnamese too :)","My methodologies are tailored to what works best for each students.

Content and language integrated learning (CLIL)- Exploring different subject material while learning language.

I aim to tailor my lessons individually, working with you at your current level with the objective of meeting your desires, whether that is to get a better grade in a class, pass an exam, or to feel more confident when traveling to an English-speaking country.

"Hi! My name is Kacie and I'm a TEFL certified English teacher from the United States. I moved to Chile 3 years ago in order to learn Spanish, and I have loved it here ever since. I had an 8 year career as an IT consultant where I specialized in the Software Development Life Cycle and Agile, but I decided to make a career change. I am now teaching General and Business English to corporate students in Santiago. It's been a wonderful experience and I am looking forward to the next big adventure!

**Please note, you can also message me directly for my availability since my schedule changes a lot during the week and I may have some additional times available**","I am a TEFL certified English teacher, and I am on my 3rd year of teaching General and Business English to corporate students in Santiago. I have taught both individual and group classes at companies like Walmart, PwC and Albemarle for all levels.

**Unfortunately, I will not be giving conversation classes for an indefinite period of time due to limited availability, but all conversation class requests that were made before May will still be honored. Thank you for understanding!**","My lessons are customized based on the English goals of my students. Since everyone has different motives for learning a new language, I want to ensure that we are focusing on what the student wants to improve upon. Additionally, I want to include resources that the students like so the classes can be fun for them (i.e. audio clips, videos, news articles, etc). I also think complete immersion is one of the best ways to learn a new language, so I try to only speak in English unless my student has an Elementary level of English. I also believe in adding a lot of conversation to the lessons since it is important for the student to practice speaking in a safe and controlled space.",https://www.italki.com/teacher/3728270/english,5.0,91 LESSONS,28 STUDENTS,91,0,33,37,"[84, 80, 88, 88]","[4, 4, 4, 8]","[10, 14, 6, 2]"

"Hi! I´m Marissa. I was born in Oregon, and moved to Mexico when I was 11 years old. I´m fluent in both English and Spanish and have been teaching both languages for over 15 years. Learning Spanish at a young age has helped me understand the struggles (and the rewards that come with it) of learning a new language.  I love traveling, books, movies, food, and getting to know each culture’s uniqueness.","Teaching has been such a fulfilling experience; for me, learning is a two way street. Every student I’ve had has taught me something different and has helped me grow as a person. I think everyone learns at their own pace, this is why I like getting to know my students in order to tailor my lessons to a style and speed that’s best for them.","Learning a new language can be difficult and scary in a way. I try to create a comfortable environment for my students and establish a fun and relaxed scenario. In my experience, I find that talking to people is the best way to loosen up and just embrace the language instead of focusing on our mistakes. We’ll focus on the areas you feel you need help with and practice from there!",https://www.italki.com/teacher/6596303/english,5.0,917 LESSONS,120 STUDENTS,917,115,124,125,"[81, 81, 81, 81]","[10, 10, 10, 10]","[49, 49, 49, 49]"
